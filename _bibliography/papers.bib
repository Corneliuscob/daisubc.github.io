abstract = {In many chemical processes, variables which indicate product quality are infrequently and irregularly sampled. Often, the inter-sample behavior of these quality variables can be inferred from manipulated variables and other process variables which are measured frequently. When the quality variables are irregularly sampled, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the model parameters can be performed using the expectation maximization (EM) approach. A state-space model identification procedure based on the EM algorithm yields a Kalman filter-based prediction-correction mechanism which can be used for optimal prediction of the quality variables. In this paper, we describe such a state-space model identification and estimation method and present the results of its application on simulation, laboratory-scale and industrial case studies. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a dynamic model of Type II diabetes mellitus with the treatment of metformin is proposed. The Type II diabetic model is a modification of an existing compartmental diabetic model. The dynamic simulation of the metformin effect for a Type II diabetic patient is based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship with a human body. The corresponding model parameters are estimated by optimization using clinical data from published reports. Then, the effect of metformin in both intravenous and oral administration on a Type II diabetes mellitus model are compared. The combination treatment of insulin infusion plus oral metformin is shown to be superior than the monotherapy with oral metformin only. These results are consistent with the clinical understanding of the use of metformin.

abstract = {The use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) and heparin derivatives as anticoagulants is an essential clinical practice in modern medicine. An overdose of these medications can lead to life-threatening bleeding episodes, and therefore antidotes are required. Fondaparinux is a new heparin derivative that has become increasingly important in clinical medicine due to its advantages over current anticoagulants. However, there is no antidote currently available for fondaparinux, and its utilization in clinics can be significantly increased by developing an effective antidote. In this article, we report the development of a mathematical model to aid the design of a polymer-based antidote for fondaparinux. A model was developed to characterize the binding between the polymer and fondaparinux. This model allows for the rapid testing of multiple polymer candidate structures in silico and thus reduces both the cost and time associated with the trial and error approach to polymer development. The model calculates the association rate constant (k(a)) from a modified Debye-Huckel equation for electrostatic interactions between charged molecules and uses this as a metric for binding affinity. The polymer is modeled as a sphere with cationic binding units randomly placed on its surface. Its size and the number and flexibility of binding units were studied through computer simulations. This model indicated that the binding units were flexible in nature and were spaced at least 9.85 x 10(-10) m apart on the polymer surface. Furthermore, it was found that smaller polymers exhibit higher k(a) values and a greater binding unit efficiency, indicating that reducing the size of the polymer molecules would enhance binding. Given the very limited information available on the interactions between the polymer and fondaparinux, this mathematical model is a powerful tool to provide qualitative information on these interactions and their electrostatic rate enhancement.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamics of fluidized beds strongly influence their operation, but are complicated and chaotic. There are many measurement techniques, but none fully characterizes gas-solid fluidized beds. Acoustic signals from fluidized beds cover a wide frequency spectrum and can be correlated to bed characteristics. Experiments were conducted to study the acoustic signals from ultrasonic transducers mounted on the outer wall of a two-dimensional fluidization column. The acoustic signals were related to bubble behavior in 550??m glass beads. Simultaneous acoustic and pressure measurements allowed direct comparison of these signals for single bubbles, pairs and chains of bubbles. The envelope of acoustic signals, generated by particle collisions and particle-wall impacts, provided information on the behavior of bubbles. Significant peaks appeared as the top portions of the bubble wakes approached the acoustic sensor. Pressure waves propagated considerably in the horizontal direction, whereas acoustic signals propagated little in the lateral direction, but transmitted forward in the wall in the direction of bubble motion, maintaining the wave profile invariant during transmission. The strong lateral localization of acoustic signals is promising for determining the lateral bubble position in the bed. Acoustic signals provide a potential means of determining such bubble properties as velocity, frequency and volume, with some advantages relative to pressure signals. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this work, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is implemented to maintain normoglycemia in a simulated Type II diabetic patient using a closed-loop insulin infusion pump. The simulation employs a compartment model, which represents the glucose regulatory system and includes submodels representing the absorption of subcutaneously administered short-acting insulin and gut absorption.

abstract = {On-line estimation plays an important role in process control and monitoring. Obtaining a theoretical solution to the simultaneous state-parameter estimation problem for non-linear stochastic systems involves solving complex multi-dimensional integrals that are not amenable to analytical solution. While basic sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filtering (PF) algorithms for simultaneous estimation exist, it is well recognized that there is a need for making these on-line algorithms non-degenerate, fast and applicable to processes with missing measurements. To overcome the deficiencies in traditional algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state and parameter estimation. Its extension to handle missing data in real-time is also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering an extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive sequential-importance- resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density estimation method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR filter for combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule to control the width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial noise added to the parameters is also proposed. The approach is illustrated through numerical examples.?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Computing the PCRLB involves solving complex, multi-dimensional expectations, which do not lend themselves to an easy analytical solution. Furthermore, any attempt to approximate it using numerical or simulation-based approaches require a priori access to the true states, which may not be available, except in simulations or in carefully designed experiments. To allow recursive approximation of the PCRLB when the states are hidden or unmeasured, a new approach based on sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filters (PFs) is proposed. The approach uses SMC methods to estimate the hidden states using a sequence of the available sensor measurements. The developed method is general and can be used to approximate the PCRLB in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian state and sensor noise. The efficacy of the developed method is illustrated on two simulation examples, including a practical problem of ballistic target tracking at reentry phase.},

However, the effect of smoothing, in the MHE algorithm, on the state estimates has not been studied in the literature. In this work the performance of the MHE is compared with recursive Bayesian state estimators (such as UKF, EnKF) to study the effect of the moving window of the past data on the quality of state estimates, via an application on a benchmark pH simulation case study. The simulations are carried out for two scenarios-the ideal case and the case with a parametric model-plant mismatch. The results obtained indicate that the use of MHE results in improved state estimates when compared to the recursive Bayesian state estimators, but does not help compensate for model-plant-mismatch. {\textcopyright} IFAC.},

abstract = {On-line estimation plays an important role in process control and monitoring. Obtaining a theoretical solution to the simultaneous state-parameter estimation problem for non-linear stochastic systems involves solving complex multi-dimensional integrals that are not amenable to analytical solution. While basic sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) or particle filtering (PF) algorithms for simultaneous estimation exist, it is well recognized that there is a need for making these on-line algorithms non-degenerate, fast and applicable to processes with missing measurements. To overcome the deficiencies in traditional algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state and parameter estimation. Its extension to handle missing data in real-time is also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering an extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive sequential-importance- resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density estimation method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR filter for combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule to control the width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial noise added to the parameters is also proposed. The approach is illustrated through numerical examples.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The dynamics of Li-ion batteries are often defined by a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations called the pseudo two-dimensional model. It is widely accepted that this model, while accurate, is too complex for estimation and control. As such, the literature is replete with numerous approximations of this model. For the first time, an algorithm for state- of-charge estimation using the original pseudo two-dimensional model is provided. A discrete version of the model is reformulated into a state-space model by separating linear, nonlinear, and algebraic states. This model is high dimensional (of the order of tens to hundreds of states) and consists of implicit nonlinear algebraic equations. The degeneracy problems with high-dimensional state estimation are circumvented by developing a particle filter algorithm that sweeps in time and spatial coordinates independently. The implicit algebraic equations are handled by ensuring the presence of a ‘tether' particle in the algorithm. The approach is illustrated through simulations. Keywords:},

abstract = {First-principles models that incorporate all of the key physics that affect the internal states of a lithium-ion battery are in the form of coupled nonlinear PDEs. While these models are very accurate in terms of prediction capability, the models cannot be employed for on-line control and monitoring purposes due to the huge computational cost. A reformulated model [1] is capable of predicting the internal states of battery with a full simulation running in milliseconds without compromising on accuracy. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using this reformulated model for control-relevant real-time applications. The reformulated model is used to compute optimal protocols for battery operations to demonstrate that the computational cost of each optimal control calculation is low enough to be completed within the sampling interval in model predictive control (MPC). Observability studies are then presented to confirm that this model can be used for state-estimation-based MPC. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) technique was implemented due to its ability to explicitly address constraints and nonlinear dynamics. The MHE uses the reformulated model to be computationally feasible in real time. The feature of reformulated model to be solved in real time opens up the possibility of incorporating detailed physics-based model in battery management systems (BMS) to design and implement better monitoring and control strategies.},

It is well known that the performance of non-linear filters depends on the underlying numerical and statistical approximations used in their design. Despite the theoretical and practical interest in evaluating the performance of non-linear filtering methods, it remains one of the most complex problems in the area of state estimation. We propose the use of posterior Cram?r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) or mean square error (MSE) inequality as a filtering performance benchmark.

Using the PCRLB inequality-based performance assessment tool, an optimal non-linear filter switching strategy is proposed for state estimation in general non-linear systems. The non-linear filter switching strategy is an optimal performance strategy, which maintains high filtering performance under all operating conditions.

abstract = {Modulating autophagy provides a new method to increase CHO cell protein production. A fed-batch protocol using the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), developed for a tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) expressing DHFR based CHO cell line, was successfully adapted to a monoclonal antibody (MAb) expressing CHOK1-SV based CHO cell line. By optimizing the timing and dose of 3-MA treatment, the cell-specific productivity was increased 4-fold, resulting in 2-fold increased total MAb production. The positive effect of the 3-MA treatment appeared to be reduced when the amino acid feed concentration was increased 5-fold. Further investigation revealed that by slowly increasing osmolality up to {\~{}}450. mOsm/kg, both the cell-specific productivity and the total MAb almost doubled. This effect was replicated with a DUXB-based CHO cell line expressing a human-llama chimeric antibody. The positive effect of gradually increasing osmolality was then combined with the positive effects of the 3-MA treatment, however their combined effect were not additive. Thus, either increased osmolality or 3-MA treatment were equally effective in increasing MAb-CHO cell fed-batch production on the cell lines tested. Analysis of protein glycosylation showed that both of these fed-batch modifications did not substantially influence the overall glycan profiles of the MAb product. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Using this sparsity, a robust statistical estimation algorithm is developed to estimate the kinetic parameters from stochastic experimental data. The algorithm is based on regularized maximum likelihood estimation and it is shown to be decomposable into a two-stage optimization. The first-stage optimization has a closed-form solution and the second-stage optimization is to maximize sparsity in the kinetic parameter vector with a guaranteed data-fitting error.

Techniques that are currently available to these industries are often too computationally intensive for an industrial control system, or they are too complex to commission. In this paper, we propose using supervised locally linear embedding for projection (SLLEP) as a new nonlinear process monitoring technique to solve these issues. In addition, we suggest using a commonly available tool in modern industrial control systems, a model predictive control, to solve the quadratic program of SLLEP in real-time and with minimal effort to commission. As a case study, we demonstrate that process monitoring with SLLEP can detect and diagnose the early onset of a semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mill overload. A SAG mill overload is a highly nonlinear operating situation, and we show that principal component analysis, the best-in-class technique currently used by the industry for monitoring an overload, is unable to detect the early onset of an overload. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for controlling the height of a mineral processing dry-surge ore pile between specified upper and lower levels by manipulating the outlet ore flow. The upper level should not be exceeded for safety, while the height should always be higher than the lowest allowable level to maintain a reserve for continuous operation downstream of the ore pile. However, this is a non-trivial control problem because the disturbance of the unpredictable discontinuous ore input must be attenuated in the continuous outlet ore flow. In addition, ore is mined from multiple sites and causes the physical properties of the ore to be uncertain. To deal with these issues, a control problem is formulated to attenuate the disturbance from the discontinuous feed and guarantee stability given the inaccurate process model. To solve the formulated control problem, a robust H∞ height controller is developed using the linear matrix inequality technique. It is shown that the robust H∞ controller attenuates four times more variability in outlet ore flow than a gain-scheduled PI controller and guarantees robust closed loop stability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.},

In order to better regulate blood glucose in a diabetic patient, improved modelling of insulin-glucose dynamics is a key factor in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In the current work, the insulin-glucose dynamics in type II diabetes mellitus can be modelled by using a stochastic nonlinear state-space model. Estimating the parameters of such a model is difficult as only a few blood glucose and insulin measurements per day are available in a non-clinical setting. Therefore, developing a predictive model of the blood glucose of a person with type II diabetes mellitus is important when the glucose and insulin concentrations are only available at irregular intervals. To overcome these difficulties, we resort to online sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) estimation of states and parameters of the state-space model for type II diabetic patients under various levels of randomly missing clinical data. Our results show that this method is efficient in monitoring and estimating the dynamics of the peripheral glucose, insulin and incretins concentration when 10, 25 and 50 {\%} of the simulated clinical data were randomly removed.},

abstract = {This study proposes a strategy for detecting possible dysfunction of organs such as the liver, pancreas, muscles and adipose tissues in a group of type II diabetic patients. Several in silico clinical trials are performed on a previously developed type II diabetes model. Since the pancreatic insulin secretion rate and glucose metabolic rates of different organs represent the functional behavior of the corresponding organs, calculated values of these rates are analyzed and compared with the corresponding rates calculated from a healthy subject's model to detect possible abnormalities. These rates are calculated from estimated values of glucose and insulin concentrations inside the corresponding organs/tissues from the physiological model. Estimation of the concentrations in body organs/tissues is carried out using a sequential Monte Carlo filtering method called particle filters. The results show that the proposed strategy is capable of detecting deficiencies in hepatic and peripheral glucose disposal, hepatic glucose production and pancreatic insulin secretion. The information provided by this strategy can potentially be used to tailor patient dietary requirements and/or select appropriate medications for the patients.

Using a magnetic circuit with the pump and its components, wear is estimated by measuring the gap between the impeller and the pump housing. As the impeller wears, the gap between the impeller and the pump housing increases causing the reluctance of the magnetic circuit to increase which in turn reduces the inductance of the coil driving the magnetic circuit. This online magnetic sensor includes an electronic circuit and has an unamplified sensitivity of 0.60 V/mm.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).We consider the problem of robust alarm design for chemical processes represented by stochastic state-space models (SSMs). Alarm design for such complex processes faces three important challenges: 1) processes exhibit highly non-linear behavior; 2) state variables are not precisely known (modeling error) and often unmeasured (hidden); and 3) process signals are not necessarily Gaussian, stationary or uncorrelated. We propose the design of a delay timer alarm for monitoring unmeasured latent variables. The proposed design reduces the false and missed alarm rates. To deal with non-stationary process behavior in normal and abnormal operations, we propose an average-case delay timer alarm design. The efficacy of the proposed robust alarm design is illustrated on a non-stationary chemical reactor.},

abstract = {The dynamics of lithium-ion batteries are complex and are often approximated by models consisting of partial differential equations (PDEs) relating the internal ionic concentrations and potentials. The Pseudo two-dimensional model (P2D) is one model that performs sufficiently accurately under various operating conditions and battery chemistries. Despite its widespread use for prediction, this model is too complex for standard estimation and control applications. This article presents an original algorithm for state-of-charge estimation using the P2D model. Partial differential equations are discretized using implicit stable algorithms and reformulated into a nonlinear state-space model. This discrete, high-dimensional model (consisting of tens to hundreds of states) contains implicit, nonlinear algebraic equations. The uncertainty in the model is characterized by additive Gaussian noise. By exploiting the special structure of the pseudo two-dimensional model, a novel particle filter algorithm that sweeps in time and spatial coordinates independently is developed. This algorithm circumvents the degeneracy problems associated with high-dimensional state estimation and avoids the repetitive solution of implicit equations by defining a ???tether??? particle. The approach is illustrated through extensive simulations.},

abstract = {The collection of sawmill residuals is an important logistic activity for the pulp and paper industry, which use the biomass as a source of energy. We study a vehicle routing problem for a network composed of a single depot and 25 nearby sawmills in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. The sawmills serve as potential suppliers of residual biomass to the depot, which in turn processes and distributes the sawmill residuals to the pulp and paper mills. This problem consists of identifying the best daily routing schedule for a fixed number of vehicles. The objective is to maximize the ratio of residual dry tonnes collected to kilometers traveled, while achieving a minimum daily amount of residual dry mass. There are several random components in the problem, including the availability and moisture content of the residuals as well as the time spent on the road to retrieve the residuals. We use a combination of scenario analysis and heuristics to solve this stochastic vehicle routing problem (SPVRP).},

As a general information theoretic method, transfer entropy can analyze the causality between two variables based on estimation of conditional probability density functions. Transfer entropy estimation is typically a data driven method, however, the associated high computational complexity and poor accuracy are not acceptable in real applications. Using a nonlinear stochastic state-space model in conjunction with particle filters, a novel transfer entropy estimation method is proposed. The proposed approach requires less data, is fast and accurate.},

@article{Barazandegan2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.Several methods have been proposed for evaluating a person's insulin sensitivity from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. However, none are easy or inexpensive to implement since the plasma insulin concentration, a key variable for assessing the insulin sensitivity index (ISI), is required to be clinically measured at specific times. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a new ISI that can be easily and accurately obtained by patients themselves without costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient testing methods. This study proposes a simple self-administered testing method, simulated on a computerized model of type II diabetic patients, for estimating the ISI. The test involves a 75-g glucose ingestion and two injections of 10 mU/kg insulin. Blood glucose is measured 1 and 2 h later. The test was evaluated by using a previously developed diabetic-patient dynamic model. Fifteen sets of OGTT data from diabetic patients published in the literature were used for the model development. A simulation of the proposed self-administered test indicates that the proposed ISI correlates well with the ISI called M-value obtained from the gold standard but elaborate euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (r = 0.927, p = 0.0045). The proposed ISI is considered to be easy to perform, time-saving, inexpensive, and accurate enough for clinical assessments.},

abstract = {Supply chain optimization for biomass-based power plants is an important
research area due to greater emphasis on renewable power energy sources.
Biomass supply chain design and operational planning models are often
formulated and studied using deterministic mathematical models. While
these models are beneficial for making decisions, their applicability to
real world problems may be limited because they do not capture all the
complexities in the supply chain, including uncertainties in the
parameters. This paper develops a statistically robust quantile-based
approach for stochastic optimization under uncertainty, which builds
upon scenario analysis. We apply and evaluate the performance of our
approach to address the problem of analyzing competing biomass supply
chains subject to stochastic demand and supply. The proposed approach
was found to outperform alternative methods in terms of computational
efficiency and ability to meet the stochastic problem requirements.

In this paper, the spatial and temporal performance limitations in the cross-directional (CD) control of paper machines are analyzed. The idea of minimum variance benchmarking is extended to the CD process based on these performance limitations. Based on an industrial CD controller, a user-specified benchmark, which is more practical and less aggressive, is also proposed. In addition, several related performance indices are proposed for the CD process based on both the minimum variance benchmark and the user-specified benchmark.
