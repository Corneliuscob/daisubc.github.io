We are at a unique historical moment with the conditions ripe for a new industrial revolution that is going to take us to a level of automation that had never been seen before. This revolution is driven by a serendipitous confluence of ubiquitous cyber-physical systems or internet of things, gargantuan computing power, inexpensive memory and major algorithmic developments in artificial intelligence. It is happening all round us in the form of self-driving cars to human-like robots. The process industries are in possession of treasure troves of heterogenous data that is gravely under utilized. The competitive global environment, and the ever increasing demands on energy, environment and quality are subjecting these industries to a high level of economic pressure. The incredible volumes of data that they already possess are poised to provide a level of automation and efficiency never seen before and thus alleviate the economic and competitive pressures. We are interested in developing novel algorithms and computational tools to bring this vision of automation to the process industry.
